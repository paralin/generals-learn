Simplified approach
===================

In this simplified approach we ask a much more basic question of the bot - given a tile-centric view of the world (for each tile in all tiles we can move, center the view on that tile in a 10x10 grid) - decide for each of the 4 directions what the predicted Q change might be.

Later we can add memory / other fancy stuff.
